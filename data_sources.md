# Potential Data Sources for Reported vs. Actual High School Completion Rates

## 1. NCES Common Core of Data (CCD)
- **Strengths:** Comprehensive annual census of all public elementary and secondary schools, includes enrollment, graduates, and dropout data. Provides consistent definitions across states.
- **Weaknesses:** May rely on state-reported data which could be subject to the same reporting discrepancies we aim to investigate. Does not include private schools.

## 2. U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS)
- **Strengths:** Large sample size, includes educational attainment data at household level, allowing estimation of completion rates for age cohorts (e.g., 18-24 year olds). Independent of school administrative reporting.
- **Weaknesses:** Self-reported data may have recall bias. Does not track individual students over time, making cohort‑based “actual” rates harder to define.

## 3. State Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS)
- **Strengths:** Track individual students from entry to exit, enabling precise calculation of cohort‑based completion rates (e.g., 4‑year graduation rate). Can link to post‑secondary outcomes.
- **Weaknesses:** Access varies by state, data quality and coverage differ. Not all states include private schools, and linking across state lines is limited.
